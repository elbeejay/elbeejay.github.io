We simulate the transport of material through numerically simulated river deltas under natural and human-modified (embankment construction and channel dredging) scenarios to understand their impacts on material transport.
Human modifications reduce the total area visited by passive particles and alter the amount of time spent within the delta relative to natural conditions.
This work can help us understand how future construction may impact land building or ecosystem restoration projects.

This project utilized the [*pyDeltaRCM*]({% link _research/pydeltarcm.md %}) and [*dorado*]({% link _research/particles.md %}) models, as well as the [*ANUGA*](https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core) hydrodynamic model, and was conducted with help from a number of colleagues at The University of Texas at Austin.
