&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-consistent&quot;&gt;Being Consistent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I want to make a change in my life and be a more consistent person. Up until
now I have just kinda been winging it with regards to my daily habits. Of
course I do things like brush my teeth and shower, but I do almost no planning
with regards to exercise, eating, or even my work. I’m lucky that I have the
flexibility to start my work days when I want, but that’s also been a curse,
as I do not have a set schedule as a result. I want to change that, any
advice?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Consistently Inconsistent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inconsistent,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the first step to solving a problem or changing your behavior is
recognizing that you want to make a change. So I am proud of your for taking
this first step. Now, let’s talk about how you can actually execute and change.
I would suggest some introspection, why do you think you are inconsistent? Do
you enjoy having flexibility in each day? Why do you wish to change that and
create additional structure? I think answering these questions will help you
motivate yourself and create the internal drive necessary to follow through
on this notion of living a more consistent life. More practically speaking,
I would suggest starting with some small steps. Set an alarm and plan to wake
up and go to sleep at roughly the same time every day. Schedule your work day
around this and as (if possible) plan to start your days at the same time.
Plan a trip to the grocery store and plan out your meals for the next week.
Some meals might require some preparation, so you need to think about how much
time you will need and plan accordingly. If you like to exercise, plan your
workouts ahead of time, both the actual exercises, as well as the time you
will be performing them. Hopefully creating these events will force some
structure into your weeks, and then you will end up needing to plan out any
other activities to fit around your established schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What are some creative ways to celebrate an anniversary when you’re unable to
be together in person?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s ChatGPT response to the prompt: “Write an advice question about anniversaries”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello ChatGPT,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fair question, and I’ve tried to think of some things that are
more creative than “why don’t you video chat and have dinner or watch a movie
together”. If you are gamers you could both game together synchronously. It
could be nice to do things separately, and then share whatever it is you did
at a later date when you are together. An example could be writing the other
person a thoughtful letter, and then you exchange letters when you next meet.
Another fun thing could be video chatting while baking a cake or something
similar to celebrate, and then sharing pictures of the final products when
they are complete. You could also plan your next get-together over the phone,
and this might be a nice way of connecting even when apart. I feel like those
are not the most creative ideas, but I think they are varied in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exciting to have our first AI submission!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;screen-less-windows&quot;&gt;Screen-less Windows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have recently bought a pair of external monitors I wanted to connect to
my laptop. However once I plugged them in, I couldn’t figure out how to
get my Windows to show up on the external screens as well as my laptop. I’m
hoping you have some advice to offer on how I might resolve my screen
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Wannabe-Techie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techie,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you decided to purchase some external monitors; they can really
improve the laptop experience. Your message is relatively sparse in terms of
details, but I can try to take some guesses as to what the problem(s) might be.
The first thing I wonder is whether or not your laptop can support two external
monitors. There is a chance the video card in your laptop (which is likely
integrated with another component) is not powerful enough to support two
external monitors and can only support one. So you might want to try connecting
just one external monitor first, before trying two. Once you are just trying
to connect one external screen, if you still have trouble, you should try
different cables if you have them. There are many different types of connectors
often used by monitors ranging from HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, VGA, and newer ones
might even support USB-C. By trying different cables and ports, you will learn
whether the problem is with a cable or an individual port, or if it is more
serious and related to the laptop or monitor itself. Since you have two
monitors, you can try each one with a given cable to help rule out the chance
that the monitor itself has a problem. If you have a second laptop or other
computer around, you could also try using that, to help isolate the source
of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;screen-less-windows&quot;&gt;Screen-less Windows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve recently moved into a studio apartment and realized that my window does
not have a screen. As it is a studio, I would like to be able to open the
window so I can air out the smells of life (as I only have one room), and
get some fresh air. However, when I opened my window the other day,
I noticed a few bugs flying around inside later that evening. I feel like
this is something I should have noticed before signing my lease, but now
it’s too late. What can I do to avoid being stuck in either a stuffy,
or bug-filled apartment?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Stuffy Studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuffy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand your predicament, I have lived in several studio apartments in my
day, and have lived in a number of different apartments that lacked screens
on windows and doors too. Why don’t apartment complexes install screens as a
matter of standard practice? I have no idea. But, fortunately for you,
I do have some suggestions. Obviously the least helpful suggestions are those
you have already proposed; endure stuffiness, or open the windows and be one
with nature. A more useful idea, is for you to look up DIY screen installation
tips online. There are a number of different solutions ranging from screens
you can nail into the frame, to those you affix with tape, to some with magnets.
What is most effective for your situation is going to depend on the type of
window and frame you have, how long you intend to live in this apartment
(and thus how permanent of a solution you want), and how much you are willing
to spend. Since you are in a studio and only mentioned window in the singular,
I suspect you only have one window. Therefore, I believe you can get a pretty
good solution for a reasonable price (less than $50, I’d imagine). So hopefully
that monetary cost and the bit of time it’ll take to install will be worth
the fresh air and peace of mind you’ll gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thermostat-tussling&quot;&gt;Thermostat Tussling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I find myself in what is likely a common predicament. I currently live with
a roommate and all is going well, except we do seem to be locked in a
perpetual argument over what temperature the thermostat should be set to.
I prefer a slightly warmer apartment and ideally would like the temperature
to be around 78 degrees in the summer and 74 in the winter. My roommate on
the other hand prefers cooler temperatures and wants us to leave the
thermostat at 72 degrees year round. In an attempt to compromise, I suggested
we leave it at 74 in the summer and 72 in the winter, but he isn’t happy
with that. What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Chill Dude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that this is probably a common situation in many shared households.
Your proposed compromise sounds reasonable to me, and I am somewhat surprised
that your roommate did not go for it. So I guess given the fact that compromise
doesn’t seem to be an option, you really have just 2 remaining choices. You can
elect to keep bickering over a few degrees, or you can give in and set the
thermostat to a cool 72 degrees. Depending on where you live and the outdoor
temperature, this may or may not be an expensive proposition. In the winter,
when the heat is on, maybe you could consider getting a small space heater to
warm yourself up in your room or when you are sitting in a single location for
a while. I can’t in good conscience recommend running the space heater in the
summer to warm up, but I guess that’d be an option too. Alternatively, you
could try to compromise again with your roommate and suggest they purchase a
fan to help keep themselves more comfortable. Ultimately you need to decide how
important this argument is, and whether or not it is worth the effort needed to
have these conversations and seek alternative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrong-side-of-the-bed&quot;&gt;Wrong Side of the Bed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I had an unfortunate experience recently. I woke up one morning with a
stiff neck, and it hurt a bit to turn my head to the left. This is unusual,
but not entirely unprecedented, so I wasn’t worried, and figured this
feeling would go away by the end of the day. To my dismay, this was not the
case. Instead, I suffered a sore neck for the next few days. This physical
malady represented, for me, a clear and distressing sign of my own aging and
mortality. It sounds ridiculous, but this experience threw me into a bit of
a funk for a few days. I’m hoping you have some advice that I can use to
help age more gracefully. Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your Newest Middle-Aged Reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a tough one to answer, as the solution to your negative thoughts
is a bit of a personal challenge you need to overcome. Each person deals with
their mortality and aging differently. One thing to keep in mind is that there
is really nothing you can do about aging. Time moves in one direction, and you
will get older, there’s nothing you can do about that part of the equation.
You can, however, try to stay physically fit and limber, and maintain a
positive mindset. So I’d recommend getting regular exercise and stretching if
you aren’t already doing that, and following a healthy diet. My favorite song
about the aging process is Baz Luhrmann’s
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI&quot;&gt;Everybody’s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)&lt;/a&gt;”, the
spoken word adaptation of Mary Schmich’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column-column.html&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;
in the Chicago Tribune. So to quote Mary and Baz: “If I could offer you only
one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision-making-difficulties&quot;&gt;Decision Making Difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I struggle with making decisions, both big and small. For example, I have
difficulty choosing an ice cream flavor when I’m at the store. I also have
trouble with decisions like where to go on vacation. I’m looking for some
help to become more decisive. Do you have any ideas or strategies you
think could help me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Undecided Advice-Seeker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undecided,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you aren’t the only person with this issue. Beyond simply telling you
to be more decisive, I have an unconventional suggestion. There is a pretty
strange book called “The Dice Man” written by George Cockcroft under the
pseudonym Luke Rhinehart, the protagonist of the story. I don’t think that the
book itself is all that great, however the main premise is related to your
dilemma. Luke believes his life is too boring, and seeks to add some
randomness. To do this, he rolls a dice before every decision. He creates a
number of different possible actions, and associates them with a single number
or a set of numbers on the die. He then rolls the die, and takes the action
associated with the number he rolled. You could adopt this approach to help
you make decisions when you are having trouble deciding between two or more
different options. It is a bit of a strange process, but it might help take the
difficulty out of making hard decisions. Maybe over time you’d realize you do
have a preference for certain choices in various scenarios!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sigh-guy&quot;&gt;Sigh Guy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues at work is what I’ve defined as a “sigh guy”. He is a
good worker, but he always seems so uneager to actually do any work. When
we have a meeting and he is assigned a task, or when someone stops by his
desk to ask a question, he begins with an audible sigh. Then he gets on with
the work, or starts to answer the question. How can I tell him this sigh is
very off-putting? It makes me feel like I am burdening him by asking him to
do his job? To be fair, I don’t know if he is actually burdened, or if this
is some sort of physical habit he associated with getting his brain in gear
before performing a task. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Congenial Coworker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congenial,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting situation to be in. It doesn’t sound like your coworker is actually
complaining about his role. Like you admit, you don’t know if these sighs are
because he is reluctant to work, or just a habit. That being said, I don’t
think you can or should ask him to stop. It sounds like he’s a good worker,
and you didn’t indicate that his answers to questions are rude or
condescending. So if that is the case, let the guy sigh. I think you should
reframe your mindset to be more accommodating of different people’s habits and
quirks. Sure, maybe sighing has a bit of a negative connotation in the
workplace, but it doesn’t seem like it is indicative of anything particularly
bad in this case. If this guy is a trainee of yours, you could mention this if
you are involved in his professional development. But if you are a colleague,
and not in a mentorship role, I would stay out of it and not mention the
sighing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The person in the office next to me whistles loudly in the morning.
It’s joyful whistling, and I don’t want to take that away from them,
but it drives me up a wall. How can I delicately ask them to stop?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Whistleblower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whistleblower,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sympathize with your situation and agree that it is a difficult position to
be in. It sounds like your objective is pretty clear, you want them to stop.
In this case, I guess you can’t tune them out or listen to other music and
actually want some quiet while you work. If you have a cordial relationship
with this coworker, I suggest you approach them directly. It is best to be
upfront and honest, but as you say, you also have to be delicate. When you
speak with your coworker about this, I think you should make this a problem
you are having, rather than their problem. You don’t want to say they are
too loud, you should say that you are sensitive to noise, and need quiet to
work efficiently. If you phrase it in a non-accusatory way, and frame the
solution as a problem you have, not something they are doing wrong, I think
this will not create a rift between you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Well anyone who has read the news lately knows that the entire cryptocurrency
market has crashed. As someone who was late to the game, but invested a lot
of money into cryptocurrencies, I am feeling crushed. How can I feel better
about myself? I’ve lost a lot of self-confidence and self-esteem as I feel
I made such poor decisions with my money. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Crushed by Crypto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crushed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel for you and I hope you don’t feel too down in the dumps. As you seem to
be aware, you aren’t the only one losing out now, the entire crypto sector is
experiencing a selloff and stocks have also been taking a plunge. I understand
that you feel a bit less confident, but you need to view this event in a more
positive light and try to make the most of it. Take it as a learning experience,
and start learning about economics and markets so that the next time you make
risky investments you are better educated. As far as feeling better about
yourself, I think some time will help.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have a friend who is a great person, but they have a problem. They’re very
charismatic and always “selling” people on whatever thing they have recently
picked up. For a stranger, this interaction seems great - they walk away
having learned about something new to check out. As a friend, I’m tired of
being given a sales pitch whenever I ask my friend how they are doing or what
is new in their life. How can tell me friend to stop trying to “sell” me on
things?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting dilemma. It sounds like you may be the less chatty of the
two of you, if your friend enjoys talking with strangers about their latest
find. To your question, I think it is a bit of a tricky spot to be in. I don’t
know your specific relationship with this friend, but if you tell them to stop
“selling” you on things, you run the risk that they will just not tell you
about what is new in their life. That situation might be the beginning of the
end for your friendship. It might be better to approach this with a more open
mind, and listen to your friend, but tell them that you have different tastes,
likes, and dislikes. Maybe you can ask them to recommend things to you that
they think are things &lt;em&gt;you specifically&lt;/em&gt; will like, and trust your friend to
be understanding. If you choose to have this kind of conversation, I would be
careful to put the “problem” on yourself, rather than on your friend. The
issue shouldn’t be presented as your friend “selling” you on stuff, but should
be presented as &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable with trying so many
new things, or doing things outside of your comfort zone. By focusing this
conversation on yourself rather than projecting the issue onto your friend, I
think you’ll have a better chance of getting the results you want without
losing your friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have a sweet tooth, and it’s becoming a problem. I’ve always had a love of
sweets, but things are beginning to spiral out of control. I generally am
enjoying candy bars or other sweets more frequently than I eat regular food.
I find myself getting irritated, tired, and sad when I go too long without
eating some candy. I need to break this habit. Do you have any suggestions
for me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crusher,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to solving any behavioral issue (in my opinion) is admitting and
recognizing that the problem exists. You’ve clearly done this and I applaud
you for it. Next, you must develop a reasonable and achievable plan of action
to change your behavior. Do you keep all of your candy in a single place? Maybe
you can start there and place some healthy snacks in front of the candy to
encourage you to make healthier decisions. You could try logging your daily
candy intake, and setting goals based on your current consumption. Once you are
able to get some sort of realistic plan put together, I suggest you go ahead
and try to follow it. Be prepared to have backslides and moments of weakness,
that’s totally normal! But I’m proud of you for recognizing your bad habit and
trying to fix it. The journey will be difficult, but you’ll ultimately
feel healthier and better in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve developed this nasty habit of comically over-reacting to things that
happen to me. For example, if I’m misstep and slightly stumble while walking,
I will exaggerate the stumble and sometimes roll on the ground. I don’t act
injured, but I turn awkward physical situations into comically over-acted
performances. While this is funny, and seems fine sometimes, I’ve started
doing this &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the time. I need some help breaking this habit. How can I
accomplish that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Drama King&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sound like a funny guy. It sounds like what was a funny one-off gag has now
become an almost compulsive habit. In that case, I’d agree that things are a
bit out of control. Do you over-act when you are totally alone and there is
nobody there to watch your “performance”? In any case, I think you need to be
hyper-aware of your actions for a little while. It might even help for you to
intentionally stumble, or misstep, and then &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; act out. This might help
re-train your brain and muscle-memory to stop over-acting when these situations
crop up more naturally. If you’re unable to fix this behavior yourself, you
could consult some sort of therapist or other healthcare professional to help
you break this habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck,&lt;/p&gt;
