*DeltaMetrics* is a Python package actively under development that aims to
provide an analysis toolbox for studying river deltas.
While *DeltaMetrics* is being developed with
[*pyDeltaRCM*]({% link _research/pydeltarcm.md %}) in mind, it is
meant to be a general purpose tool that can be applied to experimental as well
as remotely sensed data.

The project is still very much in an experimental stage, but the evolving
[documentation](https://deltarcm.org/DeltaMetrics/) and
[source code](https://github.com/DeltaRCM/DeltaMetrics) are open-source and
available. Like all open-source projects we welcome anyone that is interested
to develop something new and contribute to the project!
