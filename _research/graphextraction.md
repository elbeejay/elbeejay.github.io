*RivGraph* is a Python package which extracts a graph of nodes and links from
an input binary water mask. From the extracted graph, *RivGraph* assigns flow
directions to links and obtains channel widths and lengths. It is also capable
of producing the graph's adjacency matrix, a number of graph-related metrics,
and much more.
