*dorado* is an open-source Python package developed for the purpose of simulating
passive particle transport in landscape-scale systems. The software was written to
be flexible and compatible with outputs from any shallow-water hydrodynamic
model.

To learn more about the background behind the method, how to install the package,
and how to use it, please refer to the project's
[documentation](https://passah2o.github.io/dorado/).
If you wish to look at the
code directly, the source code is available at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/passaH2O/dorado). Current developers of *dorado* include
[Kyle Wright](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vk-wkRYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
and myself.
