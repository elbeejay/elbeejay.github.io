This is a small project in which a helper Python package was created to work
with the [Python Google Earth Engine API](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api).
The goal is to simplify and automate image acquisition from Google Earth Engine.

Instead of manually selecting imagery to download one by one, this package
simplified batch ordering of Landsat composites. To learn more about the
available functionality, how to install, and how to use this tool, please refer to the
software [documentation](https://elbeejay.github.io/py_gee_tools). The source
code is also available [here](https://github.com/elbeejay/py_gee_tools).
