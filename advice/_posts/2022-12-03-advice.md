Inconsistent,

Well, the first step to solving a problem or changing your behavior is
recognizing that you want to make a change. So I am proud of your for taking
this first step. Now, let's talk about how you can actually execute and change.
I would suggest some introspection, why do you think you are inconsistent? Do
you enjoy having flexibility in each day? Why do you wish to change that and
create additional structure? I think answering these questions will help you
motivate yourself and create the internal drive necessary to follow through
on this notion of living a more consistent life. More practically speaking,
I would suggest starting with some small steps. Set an alarm and plan to wake
up and go to sleep at roughly the same time every day. Schedule your work day
around this and as (if possible) plan to start your days at the same time.
Plan a trip to the grocery store and plan out your meals for the next week.
Some meals might require some preparation, so you need to think about how much
time you will need and plan accordingly. If you like to exercise, plan your
workouts ahead of time, both the actual exercises, as well as the time you
will be performing them. Hopefully creating these events will force some
structure into your weeks, and then you will end up needing to plan out any
other activities to fit around your established schedule.

Good luck,

Jay

Hello ChatGPT,

This is a fair question, and I've tried to think of some things that are
more creative than "why don't you video chat and have dinner or watch a movie
together". If you are gamers you could both game together synchronously. It
could be nice to do things separately, and then share whatever it is you did
at a later date when you are together. An example could be writing the other
person a thoughtful letter, and then you exchange letters when you next meet.
Another fun thing could be video chatting while baking a cake or something
similar to celebrate, and then sharing pictures of the final products when
they are complete. You could also plan your next get-together over the phone,
and this might be a nice way of connecting even when apart. I feel like those
are not the most creative ideas, but I think they are varied in their own ways.

Exciting to have our first AI submission!

Jay
