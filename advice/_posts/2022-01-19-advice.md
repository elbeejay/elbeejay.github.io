## Cranky Comrade

> Hey Jay,
>
> So I've started telling this funny joke at work now that the new year has
rolled around. This joke is totally a classic, and I enjoy making it every
January. Basically, when some topic, task, or activity comes up in
conversation and I haven't yet done it in January, I say something along the
lines of, "hm, well I haven't done <insert activity> since last year!"
>
> Now, as I'm sure you understand, that type of comedy is both hilarious and
never gets old. Well my co-worker/friend seems to disagree. He just told
me to knock it off and that it is a terrible joke. What should I do? I really
thought I was being hilarious.
>
> Thank you,
>
> Funny Guy

FG,

Well it is better to hear this criticism from a friend than your boss or
just an acquaintance at the office. But yeah, I agree with your friend, the
joke probably isn't funny beyond the first or second telling each year. So I'd
suggest you apologize to your friend, and limit your annual telling of this
wise-crack to one or two instances per year.

Laughingly yours,

Jay
