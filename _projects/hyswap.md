During my time at the USGS, the Water Mission Area was focusing on open-sourcing and modernizing software tools and methods.
Consequently, I led the initial development of the HYdrologic Surface Water Analysis Package, [hyswap](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/hyswap).

The package was designed to be function-based, as opposed to object-oriented, to be approachable to the many R-users prevalent in the USGS and the hydrologic community.
A number of methods to calculate and visualize common hydrologic statistics are included.
Examples of the package's functionality typically make use of the [Python dataretrieval package]({% link _projects/dataretrieval.md %}) to fetch USGS water data.

As an aside, I was also developing simple Python tooling to visualize USGS water data.
The *just-graphs* package itself is not yet released, but the FastAPI API I developed and served via Posit Connect is available [here](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/justgraphs-fastapi/docs) and can be used to generate instantaneous value (iv), daily value (dv), and groundwater level graphics for USGS monitoring sites.
