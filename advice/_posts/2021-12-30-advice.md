## Mapping Stuff

Cartographically Challenged,

It's a super interesting question and one I've asked myself a lot as I have
seen so many cool cartographic images, animations, and products over the last
few years. So I don't have all the answers to this question, but I can clue
you in on what I do know about the various software and procedures I've seen
people use to generate cool looking maps.

The most common software used for making maps is going to be one of the GIS
or Geographical Information System software tools. The industry leaders in this
space are the popular [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) ArcMap and ArcGIS
products, although in recent years the open-source
[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) project has been closing this gap and
provides what I think is a really nice interface. Ultimately, I think your
choice in GIS tool will be dictated by the end-goal of your map making
activities. If you have access to ESRI products and are looking to land a job
in the map making world, then it is worth the time to learn how to use the Arc
products. For hobby map making, I don't think the license is worth the cost,
however, and you should definitely explore QGIS. Even if
you want a job in GIS, I would say don't pay for ESRI, the QGIS option is very
similar, and for many things better than the ESRI alternative.

There are also several programmatic options for generating maps. Both Python
and JavaScript have a number of libraries designed for making maps, so if you
are keen on getting in to making maps via programming, consider checking those
languages and their ecosystems out. There is also
[Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/), or GMT, a
favorite of Earth, Ocean, and Planetary scientists that is essentially run from
the command line, although wrapper libraries for Matlab, Julia, and Python
do exist.

I've also seen very cool maps generated using
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/), which is an open-source 3D computer
graphics software. Blender is capable of rendering high quality animations and
other graphics, although there's a bit of a learning curve and it can be
computationally demanding to generate a graphic using it.

Happy Map Making,

Jay

## Computational Methods for Studying River Deltas

> Dear Jay,
>
> I am on the precipice of beginning a research journey looking at the
evolution of river deltas. I'm hoping to do some numerical modeling, remote
sensing, and overall just would like to become familiar with popular numerical
methods for doing this type of work. Where should I start?

RRP,

This feels like a question I would write in to myself (if I did that sort
of thing). So I will answer this in a very self-serving way, but that being
said, I encourage you to explore a bit, read the literature, and find the
models and methods best suited to what you want to do.

So, to simulate river delta evolution I encourage you to check out our
[pyDeltaRCM](https://deltarcm.org/pyDeltaRCM/) project. This model takes a
simplified approach to modeling the physics behind the formation of a river
delta, and is highly configurable. To analyze model outputs we're in the
midst of developing a companion package, currently named
[DeltaMetrics](https://deltarcm.org/DeltaMetrics/).

If, on the other hand, you want to analyze some remote sensing data, you might
consider checking out [RivGraph](https://jonschwenk.github.io/RivGraph/).
RivGraph lets you analyze channel networks through the lens of graph theory,
and comes packaged with a bunch of built-in tools and methods for easy
quantitative analysis of your data.

Good luck!

Jay
