*RivGraph* is a Python package which extracts a graph of nodes and links from
an input binary water mask. From the extracted graph, *RivGraph* assigns flow
directions to links and obtains channel widths and lengths. It is also capable
of producing the graph's adjacency matrix, a number of graph-related metrics,
and much more.

If you'd like to look at the source code, it is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jonschwenk/RivGraph). The development team behind *RivGraph* currently includes [Jon Schwenk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qHp30JkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and me.
