Think *Ask Amy* meets *Dear Prudance* meets *Ask Jeeves*, that's right,
here is my advice column! Feel free to email your questions to
[advice@jayaramhariharan.com](mailto:advice@jayaramhariharan.com) and I will
answer them here.

Questions on any topic are welcome,
I will provide advice on problems at school,
challenges in the workplace, struggles with research,
interpersonal relationship difficulties, gift giving advice,
issues of ethics and morality, and more.
