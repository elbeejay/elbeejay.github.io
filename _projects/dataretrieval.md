While at the USGS, I contributed to the development of a set of three software packages designed to facilitate the retrieval of USGS water data.
All three packages are named some variation of "dataretrieval" and their source code is available on GitHub in the [USGS Organization](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/).

An overview of the three packages was presented at the 2023 CSDMS Annual Meeting.
The poster from that presentation is available [here](https://code.usgs.gov/water/computational-tools/csdms-2023-poster/-/raw/main/poster.png?ref_type=heads).

## R: dataRetrieval

The `dataretrieval` R package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataRetrieval).

## dataretrieval

The `dataretrieval` Python package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dataretrieval/), [Conda-Forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dataretrieval), and [GitHub](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataretrieval-python).

## DataRetrieval.jl

The `DataRetrieval.jl` Julia package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/DataRetrieval.jl).
