[PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/) is a great source for published earth and environmental science data.
There I found a dataset with seal tracking data that was included as a supplement to this [Nachtsheim et al (2016) paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-016-2020-0).
I took this data and wrote some Python code to generate the below animation of seal movements in the Weddell Sea in 1998.

The code used to generate this visualization and links to the data are available on GitHub in the
[seal-tracking-gif](https://github.com/elbeejay/seal-tracking-gif) repository.
