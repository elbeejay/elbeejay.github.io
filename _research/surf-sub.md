River deltas are depositional environments, and remnants of past surface configurations are preserved in the subsurface. Based in this premise, we sought to relate surface morphology to subsurface form. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Delaware, we then looked to relate the geometry of material in the subsurface to groundwater transport behavior.
