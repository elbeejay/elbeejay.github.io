Whistleblower,

I sympathize with your situation and agree that it is a difficult position to
be in. It sounds like your objective is pretty clear, you want them to stop.
In this case, I guess you can't tune them out or listen to other music and
actually want some quiet while you work. If you have a cordial relationship
with this coworker, I suggest you approach them directly. It is best to be
upfront and honest, but as you say, you also have to be delicate. When you
speak with your coworker about this, I think you should make this a problem
you are having, rather than their problem. You don't want to say they are
too loud, you should say that you are sensitive to noise, and need quiet to
work efficiently. If you phrase it in a non-accusatory way, and frame the
solution as a problem you have, not something they are doing wrong, I think
this will not create a rift between you.

Good luck,

Jay
